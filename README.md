# Crop and Fertilizer Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict suitable crops and fertilizers based on environmental and soil parameters. It enhances agricultural decision-making by recommending the best farming practices for optimal yield.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Crop Prediction:** Suggests the best crop to grow based on soil nutrients, pH, temperature, and humidity.
- **Fertilizer Recommendation:** Provides suitable fertilizer suggestions based on soil conditions and crop requirements.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Uses classification algorithms for accurate predictions.
- **Dataset Processing:** Preprocessed agricultural datasets for model training.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes various soil parameters such as:
- **Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)** levels
- **Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall**
- **Crop suitability and fertilizer type**

## 💡 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Model:** Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM
- **Framework:** Flask (for web-based implementation)
